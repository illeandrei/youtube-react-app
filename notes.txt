Functional Component -
Is a simple function that returns some JSX.
Fun fact - functional component can contain a class based cmp.

Class based Component -
Does every thing that a functional component does, but the difference is, a class
component is controlled by state.
It return JSX through the 'render' method.

State -
Is initialized in the constructor of a class (this state = ...)
Can only be changed through the 'setState' function!
Component level state - is the state that is initialized inside the class constructor
                      - if state changes, the update are made only locally, i.e on the component of which the
                        state changed.
Application level stat - comes from redux

Controlled Component -
Is a component which is controlled by the state

Data flow -
How will all the (nested) components know about the data?
Which component should be responsible for grabbing the data?
Downwards data flow - means that only the most parent component of our App
should be responsible for fetching data (from api, or from redux, or flux).
